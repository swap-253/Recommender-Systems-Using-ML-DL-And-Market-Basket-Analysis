# Recommender-Systems-Using-ML-DL-And-Market-Basket-Analysis-Using-Apriori
This repository consists of collaborative filtering Recommender systems like Similarity Recommenders, KNN Recommenders, using Apple's Turicreate, A matrix Factorization system from scratch and a Deep Learning Recommender System which learns using embeddings. Besides this Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm has also been done.

### About Dataset 
The dataset is a movies ratings dataset from movielens and five colaborative filtering recommenders have been implemented taking care of time of ratings and its affect on the ratings of the movie i.e-temporal information. Three subdivisions of movie lens dataset have been taken.
<br>
1)__u.user__:- user info user_id,age,sex,occupation,zip_code
<br>
2)**u.data**:- containing user_id,movie_id,rating,unix_timestamp
<br>
3)**u.item**:- movie id,movie title,release date,video release date,IMDb URL and (One hot encoding of Genre categories)

**1)Similarity Recommender
<br>
2)KNN Recommender
<br>
3)Apple's Turicreate Recommender**(highly specialised and accurate)
<br>
**4)A matrix factorization method which has been implemented using Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam's Optimisation and RMS Prop separately.
<br>
5)A Deep Learning Recommender** which learns embeddings of users and movies and utilises KNN to predict the movie on the basis of user embeddings
<br>
<br>
To look at movies which are frequently highly rated by users is an example of **Market Basket Analysis**. It has been implemented using **Apriori Algorithm** in this repository.
